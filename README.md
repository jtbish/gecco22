Experimental code for the paper "Pittsburgh learning classifier systems for explainable reinforcement learning: comparing with XCS" (https://doi.org/10.1145/3512290.3528767)

This consists of code for experiments for each of the three learning systems used:

XCS: https://github.com/jtbish/xcsf-experiments

PPL-DL: https://github.com/jtbish/ppl-experiments (NOTE: PPL-DL as it is named in the paper is referred to simply as "PPL" throughout this repo and its dependencies)

PPL-ST: https://github.com/jtbish/pplst-experiments
